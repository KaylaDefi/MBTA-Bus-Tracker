Real Time Bus Tracker 

Description of the Project: This project was an assignment for my MIT xPro course. The code tracks the MBTA buses in real time and displays the location of the vehicles on a map in the browser

How to Run: You can run this project on your own machine but you will need an API key for google maps that you will insert into index.html. You also need to generate an API key here https://api-v3.mbta.com in order to use the MBTA V3 API required in the url section under the getBusLocation async function.

Roadmap of Future Improvements: I'd like to add in specific bus information so you can identify the vehicles by their number and also indicate whether the bus is close to capacity.
